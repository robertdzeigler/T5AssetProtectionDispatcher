/**
 * Determines whether access to an asset is allowed, denied, or undetermined.
 * Each contributed authorizer makes up part of a chain of command for determining access.
 * Access is explicitly allowed if accessAllowed returns true.
 * Access is explicitly denied if accessDenied returns true.
 * Ordering depends on the order specified by the "order" parameter.
 * Hence, an implementation which specifies an order of:
 * ALLOW, DENY, and returns true from both accessAllowed and accessDenied
 * will allow access for all resources. With the same return values for the
 * access* methods but the order switched to DENY, ALLOW, access to all resources
 * would be denied.  It is possible for an authorizer to have "nothing 
 * to say" regarding a particular resource.  If accessAllowed returns false,
 * it does not mean that access is denied, merely that it is not explicitly allowed.
 * If accessDenied returns false, it does not mean that access is allowed, merely that
 * it is not explicitly denied.  Hence, if both accessAllowed and accessDenied return false,
 * control will pass to the next authorizer in the chain.
